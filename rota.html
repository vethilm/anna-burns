                <h1>Rota</h1>
                <p class="body-text-flush">This is a game I made in Unity for an open-ended project in a Latin class.
                    The game is based on boards found carved in stone across the Roman Empire and is played similar to
                    Tic-Tac-Toe. Because of that, I chose to make the game look like it was carved into the ground.</p>

        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p class="body-text-flush">1. Players take turns placing one piece on the board in any open spot until all six
            (three of each color) are on the board.<br />2. Players then take turns moving one piece to an open spot
            directly adjacent to the one picked up. A piece cannot jump other pieces nor move more than one
            spot.<br />3. The first person to get three in a row, including the center, wins. The game cannot end in a
            tie.<br />4. You can clear the board and play again keeping track of the score, or you can start a new game
            and clear the scores. </p>
        <h3>Process:</h3>
        <p class="body-text-flush">I started this project by playing the game a several times on paper, making a list of
            actions and outcomes. I then made a wire frame version of the design in Unity and set up those actions.
            <br /></p>
        <div class="body-text">&gt; For the first 6 moves, tiles can be placed on any empty square<br />&gt; Afterwords,
            tiles must be picked up and placed on a different space<br />&gt; If any win condition is met, the game ends
        </div>
        <p class="body-text-flush">Now the game is playable, so long as the players follow the rules. <br /></p>
        <div class="body-text">&gt; Moved tiles must be placed adjacent to their previous position<br />&gt; Tiles
            cannot be placed back in their previous position</div>
        <p class="body-text-flush"></p>
        <p class="body-text-flush">Making this game was mostly about the programming for me, that said, there are a few
            design choices here I would change. First, the text in the rules and history is all caps and difficult to
            read, so I would definitely choose a different font. Similarly, the font on the scores doesn’t match well
            with the way the rest of the game is presented. For this, I could have changed the color and font to make it
            look more like it belongs on the board. <br />Another issue I had was with the size of the game. This was my
            first project in Unity and I didn’t know how to properly set up the project. I made the game scaled for my
            laptop and when viewed from a different device the game was cropped and unplayable.  </p>
